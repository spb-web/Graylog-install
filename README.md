# Graylog-Script
Python with shell script to install Graylog 2.4 with Elasticsearch 2.3.1 Currently only tested on Ubuntu 17.10 64-bit but feedback on script would be awesome as I am learning more advanced python techniques.


**With Elasticsearch installed locally, server must have at least 4G of RAM


First, get the script and make it executable :
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Angristan/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh
chmod +x graylog-install.sh
chmod +x graylog-conf.sh
```

Then run it :

```./graylog-install.sh```
